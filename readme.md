# VBA of Wall Street Challenge
## Purose
'The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).

The purpose of this challenge was to refactor code we had written during the asyncranis section to do the same calculations and formating but in a more efficent manor to save time and preserve syustem resources

## Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary

'What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The main advantage to refactoring code is to optimize it. When code is optimized it can preform the same functions and produce the same output while using fewer system resources and thus producing results faster. Refactoring code can also make more elegant and it easier to understand.

The disadvantages that must be considered when deciding weither of not to refactor some existing, working code are that it adds expense to the project, at least up front. Time and resources must be spent doing the gritty work of refactoring. It is also prossible that while attempting to refactor for ease of use a developer could break the old code, particularly if they don't understand the original well. Breaking working software in an attempt to optimize it leads lead to delays and cost overruns. 


'How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The advantages of the refactor are fairly obvious as described in the results section. The new code ran and produced results about six times faster than the original script.

I am having trouble coming up with any disadvantages of refactoring in this case. The only con that comes to mind is that it required a fair amount of time as I am still working to grasp the concepts and syntax of VBA.
